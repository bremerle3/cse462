Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   100 out of     600   16%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       108 out of   1,200    9%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          319
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            66 out of     319   20%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              99 out of   4,800    2%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
