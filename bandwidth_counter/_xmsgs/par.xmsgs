<msg type="warning" file="Par" num="468" delta="old" >Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in your design.

Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select &quot;Post-Place &amp;
Route Static Timing Report&quot;). Go to the failing constraint(s) and evaluate the failing paths for each constraint.

Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance(In ISE select Project -&gt; Design Goals &amp; Strategies) to ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.

<msg type="info" file="Timing" num="2761" delta="old" >N/A entries in the Constraints List may indicate that the constraint is not analyzed due to the following: No paths covered by this constraint; Other constraints intersect with this constraint; or This constraint was disabled by a Path Tracing Control. Please run the Timespec Interaction Report (TSI) via command line (trce tsi) or Timing Analyzer GUI.</msg>
